#   - the C# binding (UNesting.csproj <Version>)
#   - the Python binding (crates/python/pyproject.toml — must inherit via
#     `dynamic = ["version"]`, or pin the workspace version explicitly)

# The npm package version is produced by wasm-pack from crates/wasm/Cargo.toml,

# Enforced in CI (.github/workflows/ci.yml, "Version Consistency" job). Mismatches
# are emitted as GitHub Actions ::error:: annotations so they surface inline.
